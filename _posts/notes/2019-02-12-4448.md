# Facade Pattern

High level interface makes talking to subsystems easier.

{% capture c %}
\draw (0,5) rectangle (2, 4);
\node[] at (1, 4.5) {client};
\draw[->] (2, 4.5) -- (4,4.5);
\draw (4,5) rectangle (6, 4);
\node at (5, 4.5) {facade};
\draw (5,4) -- (4,3);
\draw (5,4) -- (6,2);
\draw (5,4) -- (5, 2.5);
\draw[dotted] (3.5, 3.5) rectangle (6.5,1.5);
{% endcapture %}
{% include tikz.html c=c %}

Works best when only accessing subset of functionality.

Without facade:

{% capture c %}
\draw (0,0) rectangle (2,1);
\node at (1, 0.5) {client};
\draw (0, 2) rectangle (2, 3);
\node at (1, 2.5) {business};
\draw (3, 0) rectangle (5, 1);
\node at (4, 0.5) {division};
\draw (3, -2) rectangle (5, -1);
\node at (4, -1.5) {employee};
\draw (3, 2) rectangle (5, 3);
\node at (4, 2.5) {database};
\draw (1, 1) -- (1, 2);
\draw (2, 1) -- (3,2);
\draw (2, 0.5) -- (3,0.5);
\draw (2, 0) -- (3, -1);
{% endcapture %}
{% include tikz.html c=c %}

With facade:

{% capture c %}
\draw (0,0) rectangle (2,1);
\node at (1,0.5) {client};

\draw (0,2) rectangle (2,3);
\node at (1,2.5) {Database facade};

\draw (3, 0) rectangle (5, 1);
\node at (4, 0.5) {Employee};

\draw (1,1) -- (1,2);
\draw (2, 0.5) -- (3, 0.5);
{% endcapture %}
{% include tikz.html c=c %}

__Ex:__ AV audio player on IOs.

__Principle of Least Knowledge:__
- only talk to your friends
- be careful how many classes objects interact with
- reduce coupling

# Adapter Pattern

Convert incompatible interface to compatible one

1. __Pre condition:__ use sustem from _A_
2. __Stimulus:__ _A_ goes out of business
3. __Response:__ _B_ has a similar library, but interface is different

{% capture c %}
\draw (0,0) -- (0,1) -- (1,1) -- (1,0.7) -- (1.3, 0.7) -- (1.3,0.3) -- (1,0.3) -- (1,0) -- (0,0);
\node[align=center] at (0.5,0.5) {existing\\system};

\draw[shift={(2,0)}] (0,0) -- (0.5,0.5) -- (0,1) -- (1,1) -- (1,0) -- (0,0);
\node at (2+0.75,0.5) {B};

\draw[shift={(4,0)}] (0,0) -- (0,0.3) -- (0.3,0.3) -- (0.3,0.7) -- (0,0.7) -- (0,1) -- (1,1) -- (1.5,0.5) -- (1,0) -- (0,0);
\node at (4+0.7,0.5) {Adapter};

\draw[->] (4,0) to [out=180+45, in=-45] (1.5,0);
{% endcapture %}
{% include tikz.html c=c %}

__Duck typing:__ If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, its probably a duck, unless its a turkey with a duck adapter.

{% capture c %}
\draw (0,0) rectangle (2,1);
\node at (1,0.5) {client};

\draw (3,0) rectangle (5,1);
\node at (4,0.5) {usual interface};

\draw (3, -2) rectangle (5,-1);
\node at (4, -1.5) {adapter};

\draw (6, -2) rectangle (8, -1);
\node at (7, -1.5) {adaptee};
