# Permutations

__Cyclic groups__ of the same size are isomorphic.

Let $S$ be a set. $Perm(S)$ is a group under composition. Subgroups of $Perm(S)$ are called "groups of permuations". __Cayley's Theorem:__ Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations. In particular, every group $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $Perm(G)$.

Let $\pi_a : G\rightarrow G$ be $\pi_a(x) = ax$, where $a\in G$. Then $\pi_a\pi_b = \pi_{ab}$ and $(\pi_a)^{-1} = \pi_{a^{-1}}$.

Let $H = \\{\pi_a \vert a\in G\\}$ be a subgroup of $Perm(G)$.

Claim $G\approxeq H$. $f:G\rightarrow H$ is $a\rightarrow \pi_a$.

$f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) \rightarrow \pi_{ab} = \pi_a\pi_b$. $f$ is bijective, so it is an isomorphism.
