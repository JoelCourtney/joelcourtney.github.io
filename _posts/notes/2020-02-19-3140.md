# Cyclic groups

__Theorem:__ let $a\in G$ and $ord(a) = m$. Then:

\\[\langle a \rangle = \\{a^n \vert n \in \mathbb{Z}\\} = \\{e, a, a^2, \dots, a^{m-1}\\}\\]

If $ord(a) = \infty$ then $\langle a \rangle = \\{a^n\vert n\in \mathbb{Z}\\}$.

__Definition:__ a group $G$ is called cyclic if $\exists c\in G$ s.t. $\langle c \rangle = G$.

Note such a $c$ is not unique. $\langle c^{-1} \rangle = G$ as well.

If $G$ is finite the $\abs{G} = ord(c)$.

__Theorem:__ let $G$ and $H$ be cyclic groups for order $m$. Then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.

__Theorem:__ There is only one infinite cyclic group: $\mathbb{Z}$.

__Theorem:__ every subgroup of a cyclic group is also cyclic.
