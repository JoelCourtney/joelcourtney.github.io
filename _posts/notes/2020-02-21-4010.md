# Explanation

The __causal effect__ of an action is the difference between the outcomes where the action was or was not taken.

Suppose we want to measure the effect of a predictor on the response.

\\[Y_i = \beta_0 + \gamma E_i + \beta_1X_{i,1} + \dots + \beta_pX_{i,p} + \epsilon_i\\]

$Y_i$ is weight loss, $E_i$ is excercise type.

$X_j$ are other variables to account for.
