# Partitions and Equivalence Relations

Every partition $P$ gives rise to an equivalence relation. Given $a,b\in S$, $a\sim b$ if $a,b\in A_i$ for some $i$. This is RST, but I'm not going to write out the proof.

Every equivalence relation on $S$ gives rise to a partition of $S$. Given $\sim$ on $S$, define for $x\in S$:

\\[\bqty{x} = \\{y\in S\vert y\sim x\\}\\]

$\bqty{x}$ is called the equivalence class of $x$. So the partition induced by $\sim$ is \$P=\\{\bqty{x}\vert x\in S\\}$.

Suppose $\bqty{x}\cap\bqty{y} \neq \varnothing$. Then $\exists z\in\bqty{x}$ and $z\in \bqty{y}$. So $x\sim z$ and $z\sim y$. So $x\sim y$ by transitivity. So $\bqty{x} = \bqty{y}$.

$x$ and $y$ are called equivalence class representations.

$P_\sim$ is the partition induced by $\sim$, and $\sim_P$ is the equivalence relation induced by the partition $P$.

$P_{(\sim_P)} = P$, and $\sim_{(P_\sim)} = \sim$. Also both $P$ and $\sim$ are equivalent to a surjective map $f:S\rightarrow P$.
