# Expansion of the Universe

Redshift of galaxies confirms that distant galaxies are receding with increasing velocity.

Rest wavelength $\lambda_0$, observed wavelength $\lambda$. $\delta\lambda=\lambda-\lambda_0$.

__Define:__ redshift:

\begin{align}
z &= \frac{\delta\lambda}{\lambda_0} \\\ 
&= \sqrt{\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}}
\end{align}

where $\beta = \frac vc$. If $\beta<<1$, then $z\approx\sqrt{1+2\beta}-1\approx\beta$. Reverse equation:

\\[v=c\left(\frac{(z+1)^2-1}{(z+1)^2+1}\right)\\]

## Hubble's Law

\\[v=H_0D\\]

where $H_0\approx 71\left[\frac{km}{s\cdot Mpc}\right]$ is the Hubble constant, $v$ is recession velocity, and $D$ is the distance.

Also sometimes $H_0$ is written $100h\left[\frac{km}{s\cdot Mpc}\right]$ where $h$ is a dimensionless scalar.

We are in a homologous (isotropic) expansion. You've seen the illustrations.

Age of the universe: $T = \frac 1{H_0} \approx 1.38\cdot10^{10}[yr]$, if the expansion is constant.
