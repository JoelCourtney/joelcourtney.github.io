# Hello

![example image](/assets/images/blue.png){: #mugshot}
Test image that will eventually be me with sexy hair:  
I am a fifth-year undergraduate at CU Boulder studying Physics, Astrophysics, Computer Science, and Applied Math. I plan to graduate in May 2021.

I built this website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), Markdown, and Bootstrap; so I alone am to blame for the atrocious color scheme.
