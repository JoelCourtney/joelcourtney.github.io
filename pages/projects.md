# My Projects

## Hadron

[Hadron](https://github.com/JoelCourtney/hadron) is a simple scripting language for basic physics calculations. Check out the Hadron [tab](/hadron) for details on features and syntax. The interpreter is not yet fully-featured, but it is functional enough that I regularly use it for school work.

The interpreter is written in Kotlin and ANTLR, and runs on the JVM. I don't plan to properly optimize it with JIT compilation as is done in modern interpreters. The repo is well organized but only partially documented. (Catching the docs up is the current task.)

## DnDCent

[DnDCent](https://github.com/JoelCourtney/dndcent) is a minimalist open-source knock-off of DndBeyond. It is a web-based locally hosted character sheet viewer and editor, showcasing my staggering lack of front-end UI design skills. It is very much still a work in progress.

## MarkDoc

[MarkDoc](https://github.com/JoelCourtney/markdown-server) is a custom markdown rendering tool with support for MathJax equations, Tikz diagrams, server-side Python and Hadron code execution (very much not secure), and table-of-contents generation. I use it when I want to quickly create documents with equations and/or code in them, but don't want to bust out a full LaTeX document.
